Are you interested in introducing your peers, students, or lab group to Open Science, or thinking about offering engaging workshops on the topic? Or are you simply interested in how to make your teaching better? This interactive, evidence-based workshop combines core didactic principles with practical tools to help you effectively teach Open Science to researchers and students. Participants will learn about the foundations of successful learning, how to set learning goals, design engaging lessons, and engage audiences through a variety of activation methods. A special focus is placed on hands-on exercises to not only equip you with essential tools to plan, design, deliver, and adapt hands-on content on Open Science, but also to explore and adapt activation techniques that boost motivation and attention in classroom settings. Whether you're new to teaching or looking to enhance your skills, this workshop will equip you with strategies to plan, deliver, and adapt compelling Open Science content. No prior teaching experience is required—just curiosity and a desire to apply these didactic skills in the context of Open Science. At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Explain key theoretical frameworks around learning and knowledge acquisition
- Formulate clear and measurable learning goals for sessions on Open Science topics
- Design course materials and learning activities tailored to teaching Open Science principles to diverse audiences, including students and researchers.
- Select from different activation methods and apply them in practise
- Apply and adapt didactic tools and techniques to meet the needs of various learners, regardless of their prior knowledge or background in Open Science.

Are you keen on implementing Open Science and would like to learn more about the surrounding issues and potential challenges that come with it? Do you want to be prepared to be an advocate for something that is currently still “outside the norm” and sometimes met with skepticism? In this workshop, we will interactively discuss issues connected to Open Science and challenges around its implementation. At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Critically assess the principles and challenges of Open Science in academic practice and identify common barriers to implementing Open Research practises such as accessibility, diversity and citation politics.
- Develop the skills and confidence to lead, moderate, and advocate for Open Science initiatives, including workshops and lectures.
