    "text": "Uli Dirnagl: Reducing waste and increasing value of biomedical research\n Tuesday 12 September, 9:00-9:45\nRecent advances in biomedical research provide innumerable opportunities to develop novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, only a small fraction of biomedical discoveries are successfully translated into clinical applications. Potential ‘breakthrough’ therapies, which are spectacularly successful in animal models of disease, often fail in clinical trials. This translational bottleneck imposes burdens on research and healthcare systems, as well as patients who participate in trials of novel strategies. The high attrition rate of preclinical to clinical development may directly relate to concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of biomedical research. Apparently there are substantial weaknesses in planning, conducting, analysing, and reporting this research. Low internal and external validity as well as low statistical power in particular of preclinical research appears to produce a very high rate of false positives, and inflates effect sizes unrealistically. Not surprisingly then, the majority of scientists believe that we are in the midst of a ‘reproducibility crisis’. The immense proliferation in research outputs, combined with increasing methodological complexity and the size of data sets, greatly complicates the sharing, evaluation, and synthesis of high quality evidence. At the same time, nonpublication of results leads to duplicative research and deprives medical decision-makers of the totality of evidence. But how can we overcome this crisis?\nIn his presentation, Prof. Dr. Uli Dirnagl, Head of Department of Experimental Neurology at the Charité in Berlin, Co-founder and Director of the Center for Stroke Research Berlin, and Founding Director of the QUEST Center for Responsible Research at the Berlin Institute of Health, will present a set of behaviours, activities and research practices which present prime targets for improvement."

    "text": "Richard McElreath: Science as amateur software development\n Wednesday 13 September, 9:00-9:45\nScience is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Academia, on the other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a profession is largely *unprofessional*—apprentice scientists are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software development has become indispensable to scientific work.\nProf. Dr. Richard McElreath, Director of the Department of Human Behavior, Ecology, and Culture at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, will playfully ask how software development can become even more useful by transferring some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed, open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be distributed, open-source knowledge development."

In software engineering, there is a common saying that “code is read by humans more than it is executed by computers”. Whether this is exactly true or not, one message remains: readability counts. This is even more so in research, as code is often the only available detailed description of the computational experiments of data analyses underlying your research. This lecture will cover simple techniques to make your codes easier to read - by yourself, your colleagues or your peers reproducing your research."

Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Julia’s user-friendly interface, resembling popular languages like R, Python, and Matlab, makes it easily accessible for learners. Its focus on performance, however, enables computational speeds that often rival, or even surpass, those of low-level languages such as C or Fortran. Therefore, Julia is an ideal choice for large-scale data analysis and other computationally intensive tasks, as it can be orders of magnitude faster than R or Python.\nIn this workshop, we will introduce you to the basics of Julia and the key features setting it apart from other languages.\nThis workshop is designed for R users who are interested in learning a new programming language or want to improve their skills in data analysis and scientific computing. No prior experience with Julia is required, but a understanding of R is recommended.\nDepending on the number of attendees from the summer school planned for this workshop, we may open it to public registration (with priority to LMU members). If so, it will be advertised on the LMU Open Science Center mailing list.\nA team from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, the Max Planck School of Cognition, and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research will instruct this workshop: Dr. Aaron Peikert, post-doctoral fellow, Maximilian Ernst, PhD student, and Moritz Ketzer, PhD student.\nThe self-paced tutorial for this workshop can be found here: https://formal-methods-mpi.github.io/Workshop.jl/stable/"

    "text": "FAIR research data management\nReema Gupta, Laura Meier   Tuesday 16 September, 10:00-11:45\nEDIT For selected participants who already know the basics of R, there will be the opportunity to learn the basics of the Julia programming language through a facilitated self-paced tutorial. Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Julia’s user-friendly interface, resembling popular languages like R, Python, and Matlab, makes it easily accessible for learners. Its focus on performance, however, enables computational speeds that often rival, or even surpass, those of low-level languages such as C or Fortran. Therefore, Julia is an ideal choice for large-scale data analysis and other computationally intensive tasks, as it can be orders of magnitude faster than R or Python.\nIn this workshop, we will introduce you to the basics of Julia and the key features setting it apart from other languages.\nThis workshop is designed for R users who are interested in learning a new programming language or want to improve their skills in data analysis and scientific computing. No prior experience with Julia is required, but a understanding of R is recommended.\nDepending on the number of attendees from the summer school planned for this workshop, we may open it to public registration (with priority to LMU members). If so, it will be advertised on the LMU Open Science Center mailing list.\nA team from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, the Max Planck School of Cognition, and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research will instruct this workshop: Dr. Aaron Peikert, post-doctoral fellow, Maximilian Ernst, PhD student, and Moritz Ketzer, PhD student.\nThe self-paced tutorial for this workshop can be found here: https://formal-methods-mpi.github.io/Workshop.jl/stable/"
