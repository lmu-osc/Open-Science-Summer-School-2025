## Hybrid networking

Monday 15 September, 13:15-14:15

In person and online participants will get to know each other in two rounds of speed-networking discussions in small groups, each with a 360 degrees camera-microphone.

## Introduction to R

**Sarah von Grebmer**\
![](img/sarah-von-grebmer.png){width="100"} Monday 15 September, 14:30-17:30

This beginner-friendly R workshop introduces participants to the fundamentals of the R programming language in the RStudio environment for data wrangling. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn how to navigate RStudio, import and manipulate data and create basic visualizations. No prior programming experience is required. By the end of the session, participants will have the skills and confidence to begin using R for their own research projects. **Basic R knowledge is needed for the rest of the course**.

LMU psychologist [Maximilian Frank](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/members/individual_members/fellows/frank/index.html) will facilitate this workshop.

## FAIR research data management

**Reema Gupta, Laura Meier** ![](img/reema-gupta.png){width="100"} ![](img/laura-meier.png){width="100"} Tuesday 16 September, 10:00-11:45

This interactive session is centered around the FAIR principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—and their practical application in managing your research data efficiently. Learn to manage your data in a way that enhances its value and accessibility for the wider research community.

How? Appreciation of adequate data management mostly occurs very late, e.g., when looking into someone else’s data folder. We are therefore artificially advancing this experience: You will investigate a publicly available dataset and complete exercises regarding data organization, documentation, and publication aspects. We will conclude with an introduction to data management plans, a helpful planning tool to comply with the FAIR principles.

## Preregistration

**Malika Ihle**\
![](img/malika-ihle.png){width="100"} Tuesday 16 September, 13:15-15:15

In this workshop, we will review what detailed information preregistrations and registered reports should contain, and discuss collectively discuss the benefits and disadvantages of embracing such practices, as well as possible fear and concerns, in a structured academic debate. Finally, we will look into how to preregister in practice on the Open Science Framework, and practice the level of precision needed in each section of a preregistration template by peer-reviewing snippets.

## Simulations of data and data analyses in R

**Malika Ihle**\
![](img/malika-ihle.png){width="100"} Tuesday 16 September, 15:30-17:30

You will be guided through the What, Why, and How of simulations of data and data analyses. We will follow this self-paced tutorial: <https://github.com/lmu-osc/Simulations-for-Advanced-Power-Analyses>. The material covers the concept of power analyses for simple tests, how to check for false positive rates, and how simulations can help with preparing a preregistration. Basic knowledge of the R syntax is needed.

## Research data management (RDM) plans

**Laura Meier**\
![](img/laura-meier.png){width="100"} Wednesday 17 September, 13:15-14:15

The planning of a research project and the management of one’s own data bring many advantages in everyday research. [Laura Meier](https://www.ub.uni-muenchen.de/ueber-die-ub/kontakt/personen/meier-l/index.html), from the RDM information team of University Library of LMU Munich, will present what to look for when creating a data management plan and how web-based tools such as the Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) can be used to make work easier.

## Version control in RStudio with Git

**Malika Ihle, Reema Gupta, Florian Kohrt**\
![](img/malika-ihle.png){width="100"} ![](img/reema-gupta.png){width="100"} ![](img/florian-kohrt.png){width="100"} Wednesday 17 September, 14:30-17:30

In this facilitated self-paced tutorial, you will learn the basic concept of version control using RStudio as one of many possible GUI interfaces that can interact with Git. You will learn how to use version control for your own workflow (Git within RStudio with backup online on GitHub) and for collaborative coding (fork, clone, pull requests on Github). The self-paced tutorials can be found at: <https://github.com/lmu-osc/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/> and <https://github.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub>.

LMU Open Science Center content developer and PhD candidate [Reema Gupta](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/coordinator/index.html) and LMU psychologist [Florian Kohrt](https://www.psy.lmu.de/pm/personen/lehrstuhlmitarbeiter/kohrt_florian/index.html) will co-facilitate this session.

## Quarto

**Pat Callahan, Florian Kohrt**\
![](img/florian-kohrt.png){width="100"} Thursday 18 September, 10:00-11:45

Quarto makes transparent and reproducible data analysis simple and fun. In a nutshell, Quarto lets you mix text written in markdown with chunks of executable code written in, e.g., R or Python. You can use it for interactive notebooks, and export to a large number of formats including HTML, PDF/LaTeX, Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or even interactive websites. In this workshop, we cover the fundamentals, including the markdown syntax, code chunks and inline code, and the output formats available. We also go over citations, cross-referencing, and templating, which ultimately allow you to write academic papers entirely in Quarto.

LMU psychologist [Florian Kohrt](https://www.psy.lmu.de/pm/personen/lehrstuhlmitarbeiter/kohrt_florian/index.html) will facilitate this workshop.

## Reproducible R environment and code publishing

**Florian Kohrt, Pat Callahan, Reema Gupta** ![](img/florian-kohrt.png){width="100"} ![](img/reema-gupta.png){width="100"} Thursday 18 September, 13:15-16:15

EDIT This workshop provides an introduction to best practices for sharing and disseminating code in a reproducible and transparent manner. It integrates key concepts such as version control, documentation, and creating accessible repositories using platforms like GitHub. You will learn how to structure your code, ensure it is well-documented, and effectively communicate methods and results. The workshop emphasises the importance of reproducibility and Open Science, enabling researchers to share their work in a way that is clear, verifiable, and easily accessible to the broader scientific community.

## Q&A

**Malika Ihle**\
![](img/malika-ihle.png){width="100"} Friday 19 September, 11:00-11:45 

In this interactive Q&A session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions about your own projects and receive tailored guidance from the instructors and facilitators. Whether you're facing challenges with your code, or one of the topics covered during this summer school, this session provides a space for personalised support, troubleshooting and solution-focused group discussions.

## Where to go from here? Facilitated group discussion

**Sarah von Grebmer**\
![](img/sarah-von-grebmer.png){width="100"} Friday 19 September, 13:15-14:15

Dr. [Sarah von Grebmer](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/members/individual_members/lmu-members/wolfsthurn/index.html), the LMU Open Science Center Train-the-Trainer Program coordinator, will facilitate a discussion on how you can plan to integrate parts of this course into your research and the strategies you can put in place to best support yourself in reaching your goals, following the "Ten simple rules for implementing open and reproducible research practices after attending a training course" (<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010750>).
